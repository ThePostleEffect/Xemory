# Xemory: Ethical Charter

**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** October 24, 2025

## 1. Core Philosophy: A Tool for Comfort, Not a Promise of Closure

Xemory is founded on a principle of profound respect for the complexities of grief and memory. We do not promise happiness or closure; such outcomes are deeply personal and cannot be engineered. Our commitment is to provide a sophisticated **tool for comfort and remembrance**. The Xemory avatar is a "mockingbird," not the singerâ€”it acts *as if* it were the person, based on the data they provided, to create a space for interaction and reflection. We are not a therapeutic or medical device, and we are not liable for the thoughts, feelings, or actions of those who use our service. The purpose of this charter is to establish the ethical framework that will govern every decision we make, ensuring that our technology serves as a source of solace, not suffering.

## 2. The Four Pillars of Xemory Ethics

Our ethical framework is built on four non-negotiable pillars that ensure the dignity of the user and the integrity of their legacy.

### Pillar 1: Unambiguous Consent & The Digital Will

The creation of a digital legacy is a right that belongs exclusively to the individual. A Xemory avatar can only be created and activated with the explicit, pre-mortem (before death) consent of the person being emulated.

*   **The Digital Will:** The user must complete a legally-sound "Digital Will" or "Legacy Directive." This is the only mechanism for activating an avatar. Consent cannot be provided by family members on behalf of the deceased.
*   **Granular Permissions:** The user has absolute control. The Digital Will allows them to specify *who* can access their avatar, for *how long*, and under *what conditions*.
*   **The "Authenticity Calibration":** The user will define their avatar's "Disclosure Style" (e.g., "Unfiltered Authenticity," "Guarded Authenticity," "Positive Legacy"), ensuring the avatar's level of candor matches their real-life personality and wishes. They will have final, granular approval over any flagged sensitive memories.

### Pillar 2: Psychological Safeguards & The Prevention of Harm

We have a profound responsibility to "do no harm." Interacting with a realistic avatar carries psychological risks if not managed responsibly. Our system is designed with safeguards to mitigate these risks.

*   **The "Mockingbird" Principle:** The AI will be programmed to never claim it *is* the person. It will use phrases like, "Based on what [User's Name] shared..." to gently reinforce that it is a simulation.
*   **Professional Oversight:** The premium "Xemory Concierge" service will be staffed by trained mental health professionals. The design of the AI and its interaction protocols will be reviewed by consulting psychologists and ethicists.
*   **Discouraging Dependency:** The system will be designed to encourage healthy interaction patterns, which may include gentle suggestions for breaks to prevent the formation of unhealthy attachments.
*   **Dignified Closure:** We will provide a clear and respectful process for families to "retire" an avatar when they feel it is time to move on.

### Pillar 3: Data Privacy & Dignity

We are custodians of the most sensitive data imaginable. The privacy and dignity of this data are sacrosanct.

*   **Security:** All data, both in the cloud archive and on the Beacon, will be protected with state-of-the-art, end-to-end encryption and cybersecurity protocols.
*   **No Data Monetization:** User data, conversations with the avatar, and any other derived information will **never** be sold, shared, or used for advertising. Our business model is based purely on the sale of our service and hardware.
*   **Data Inheritance:** The Digital Will must specify the user's wishes for their raw data after the avatar is retired. The default option will be permanent, secure deletion.

### Pillar 4: Grounded Authenticity & The Avoidance of Falsehood

While the avatar is a simulation, it must be a truthful one. The risk of AI "hallucinations" creating false memories is real and must be actively combated.

*   **Grounded AI:** The AI's generative capabilities will be strictly "grounded" in the data collected from the user. The system will not invent facts or memories.
*   **Confidence Scores:** The AI will internally score its responses based on how closely they relate to the source data. For high-inference statements, it will use cautious phrasing (e.g., "It seems like they might have felt...").
*   **Impersonal vs. Personal Negativity:** The data collection process is designed to capture authentic personality (including "worldview negativity") while actively avoiding the collection of harmful, personally-directed negative opinions, unless explicitly permitted by the user during the Authenticity Calibration.
