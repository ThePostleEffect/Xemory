# Xemory: Data Collection Playbook

**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** October 24, 2025

## 1. Introduction: Capturing the Authentic Essence

This document provides the official methodology for collecting the data required to create a Xemory avatar. This process, known as the "Guided Legacy Session," is the most critical element of our platform. It is designed to be respectful, engaging, and efficient, capturing not just a person's voice and likeness, but their true essence and the unique dynamics of their most important relationships. This playbook is to be used by both the automated "Conversational AI Partner" and the human "Xemory Concierge" to ensure a consistent, high-quality, and ethically sound data collection process.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Tool for Comfort:** We are not providing therapy; we are creating a tool for remembrance. The process should be positive and affirming.
- **Essence over Exhaustion:** The goal is not to record every memory, but to capture a rich and representative sample of the person's character and communication style.
- **User as Curator:** The user is in complete control. They decide what to share, how it's shared, and who can access it.
- **Safety by Design:** The process is engineered to proactively avoid causing harm by distinguishing between authentic personality and toxic, personal negativity.

## 3. The Guided Legacy Session: A Step-by-Step Process

The session is broken down into four distinct modules, designed to be completed in a single, comfortable session (or multiple sessions if the user prefers).

### Module 1: The Universal Stimulus Session (Facial Dynamics)

**Goal:** To capture a wide range of authentic, involuntary facial expressions.

**Process:** The user watches a carefully designed 90-second video while their face is recorded by their device's camera. The video contains a sequence of stimuli designed to elicit universal emotional reactions.

| Time | Stimulus Type | On-Screen Content Example | Target Emotion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0-15s | Surprise / Novelty | A simple sketch suddenly bursting into a complex, colorful 3D world. | Surprise |
| 15-30s | Joy / Hilarity | A clever, universally funny clip of physical comedy. | Joy/Happiness |
| 30-45s | Sadness / Empathy | A poignant animated scene of farewell or loss. | Sadness |
| 45-60s | Disgust | A clip of someone reacting to a strange but non-offensive food. | Disgust |
| 60-75s | Fear / Suspense | A suspenseful moment, like a character cautiously opening a door in a dark room. | Fear |
| 75-90s | Anger / Frustration | A relatable frustration, like a key breaking in a lock. | Anger |

### Module 2: The Conversational AI Partner (Vocal & Personality Dynamics)

**Goal:** To capture the user's natural voice, narrative style, and "impersonal" personality traits in a dynamic, conversational setting.

**Sub-Modules:**

1.  **The Storytelling Partner:** Elicits positive memories and narrative style.
    *   *"Tell me about a time you felt truly proud of an accomplishment."*
    *   *"Describe a favorite vacation. What made it so special?"*

2.  **The Opinion Partner (Impersonal Negativity):** Captures authentic critical thinking and personality-based negativity in a safe context.
    *   *"What's a popular movie or TV show that you secretly can't stand? Why?"*
    *   *"Describe a common pet peeve that drives you crazy."*
    *   *"What's a modern trend that you're cynical or pessimistic about?"*

3.  **The Rapid-Fire Partner:** Captures pure vocal tone in short bursts.
    *   *"Coffee or tea?"*
    *   *"Mountains or the ocean?"*
    *   *"Early bird or night owl?"*

### Module 3: The Relational Calibration (The Heart of Xemory)

**Goal:** To capture the unique communication dynamic for each of the user's key relationships.

**Process:** The following steps are repeated for each person the user adds (e.g., spouse, child, best friend).

1.  **Define the "Normal":** The AI asks the user to describe their typical interactions with the specific person.
    *   *"Let's talk about Sarah. What is 'normal' for you two? Are your conversations mostly joking and lighthearted, or deep and serious?"*

2.  **Capture Uniqueness:** The AI probes for the specific details that make the relationship unique.
    *   *"Do you have any nicknames for each other? What about inside jokes that only you two would understand?"*

3.  **Understand Conflict Style:** The AI asks how disagreements are handled in that specific relationship.
    *   *"Think about the last time you and Sarah had a disagreement. How did you resolve it? Was it a heated argument, a calm discussion, or did you both need space?"*

4.  **Optional Video Upload:** The user is encouraged to upload a short video clip of them interacting with that specific person to provide the AI with invaluable "ground truth" data.

### Module 4: The Authenticity Calibration & Digital Will

**Goal:** To give the user final, granular control over their avatar's behavior and to secure their legal consent.

**Process:** This is the final step of the setup.

1.  **The Disclosure Style Quiz:** The user answers a short quiz to define their avatar's default level of candor (e.g., "The Open Book," "The Diplomat," "The Private Person").

2.  **Flagged Memory Review:** If the system flagged any potentially sensitive "personal negativity" during the session, the user is presented with them here and given explicit options: **Include**, **Redact**, or **Restrict** each memory.

3.  **The Digital Will:** The user signs the final, legally-binding document, confirming their consent and defining the access permissions for their Xemory avatar. This step is mandatory for the avatar to ever be activated.
